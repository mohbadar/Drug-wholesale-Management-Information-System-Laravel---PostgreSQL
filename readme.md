#Drug Wholesale Open Source System

Majority of small-sized drug wholesale companies do not have any system to manage their daily activities. Or even they cannot afford buying or developing a system. However, I having a system allows companies to significantly improve their productivity and also have a clear and accurate view of their stocks, for instance, they can easily see the expired and nearly expired drug items in the stocks. Thus, I decided to develop an open-source system for them. This system can manage daily information.
